## Task Description

Using the [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started), create a React + TypeScript application with the following features:

## Requirements

1. **Landing Page:**
   - Implement a search bar to filter movies by name and category.
   - Display a list of movies.
   - Each movie item should include:
     - Poster image
     - Movie name
     - Release date
   - Implement pagination to navigate through different lists of movies.

2. **Movie Details Page:**
   - When a movie is selected from the landing page, navigate to a details page.
   - Fetch and display detailed information about the selected movie using a different API endpoint than the landing page.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the application is fully responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.

 4. **Animations:**
	- Add subtle animations to enhance user experience, such as hover effects on movie items and smooth transitions between pages.
 
 5. **Unit Testing:** - Nice to have
	- Write unit tests for components using a testing library like Jest.
