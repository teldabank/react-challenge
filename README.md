# Image Carousel React Task

### Task Description

The goal of this task is to create a basic image carousel similar to the one used in Instagram. The image carousel should allow users to navigate through a set of images using next and previous buttons, with a transition animation between images.

### Requirements

1.  Create a React component named `ImageCarousel`.
2.  Fetch image data from the provided [URL](https://mocki.io/v1/1f0d69ac-34b4-4a75-be4a-88971525d1c5)
3.  Display the fetched images within the carousel.
4. Display image caption below each image in the carousel.
5.  Implement invisible navigation buttons on the right and left sides of the image. Clicking on the right part of the image should navigate to the next image, and clicking on the left part should navigate to the previous image.
6.  Create a smooth transition animation between images.
7.  Allow users to navigate in a circular manner (from the last image to the first and vice versa).

### Bonus Points

- Add additional features like autoplay, or responsive design.
- Include tests.
- Include additional mock data
